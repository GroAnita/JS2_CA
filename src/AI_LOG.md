As I started this project before we new about this AI Log, I dont have exact dates or prompts. But I will try to remember most of it.

## Entry 1

**Date:** jan 19th - 25th 2026
**Task:** Color scheme for website

**Prompt Used:**
Dont remember exact prompt but I asked AI to help find a good color scheme for my witch social media app and i wanted to use purple colors.
I also asked AI to help me find more witchy names for everything really. Like search is now Scry, and newsfeed is the Grimoire and so on.

I also asked AI for what it thought would be a good folder setup for my SPA project. It told me I should use src with the folders: router, service, views, utils, ui and state. I have since chosen to add components and initialize to my system to complete it.
