As I started this project before we new about this AI Log, I dont have exact dates or prompts. But I will try to remember most of it.

## Entries

**Date:** jan 19th - feb 22nd 2026

**Prompt Used:**

**Color scheme and witchy names**
Dont remember exact prompt but I asked AI to help find a good color scheme for my witch social media app and i wanted to use purple colors.
I also asked AI to help me find more witchy names for everything really. Like search is now Scry, and newsfeed is the Grimoire and so on.

**Folder setup**
I also asked AI for what it thought would be a good folder setup for my SPA project. It told me I should use src with the folders: router, service, views, utils, ui and state. I have since chosen to add components and initialize to my system to complete it.

**Console errors**
I frequently use AI to help interpret console errors. While the console provides error messages, I find it easier to understand the underlying cause when it is explained in plain language.
For example, AI helped me identify and understand a scope issue that resulted in an uncaught promise error. This helped me to improve my debugging confidence.

**Routing issue**
I Also had to ask it when I had some issued with my router and github pages, I had a rough idea and it helped me finesse it so it worked properly.
This is that code :
const base = '/JS2_CA';
let path = window.location.pathname;

if (path.startsWith(base)) {
path = path.slice(base.length) || '/';
}

**TailwindCSS**
Another thing it helped me with was to install tailwindcss, I wanted to try it out and immediately got some issues that AI helped me solve. Like going back 1 vs. and also fix the vite configs for using it.
And ofcourse in the beginning how to use tailwindcss, but it has been very intuitive to learn the way I have done it in this assignment, and we will probably learn to do it in a totally different way soon!

**Optional chaining**
Used Ai to learn more about optional chaining after reading about it on MDN first. Had some issues that almost crashed things for me, and this was a solution that I had in the back of my mind and had noted in my notebook , but was not that familiar with so I asked. might be using it too much now.. but still learning.

**RegEx**
I have also asked AI for help with regex, not sure if I ever will be able to memorize a proper regex... It can be found in my validation.js

**Query Parameters**
Asked AI about these because I hit a roadblock with them, I figured it out myself in the end, but I asked it to explain it to me more. Because I see and understand that code belongs together, but that doesnt always mean that I have total understanding of it so when I hit these roadblocks I need it explained again so that my mind says " AAAH right thats what that was"

**new Map()**
I use this in my caching of my unsplash images, I read about this and needed some more explanation around this than stackoverflow and the moduls gave me so I asked AI about it. I did not 100% agree with the response so I buildt it with the knowledge it gave me , and it does work so happy with that.

**JSDoc**
Most recently I have used Ai to help me with what to put in @params in JSDocs on a couple of functions, untill I got more of a grasp on it.

### Reflection

As a beginner I sometimes feel very unsure if my solutions are correct. AI is a valued learning support too for me.
It helps me get at better understanding of: 
* console errors
* confirming my design decisions
* make deeper meaning of concepts I am using and learning
* and definetly improve my problem solving skills

So in the end I am using AI as a support to my learning , not to replace my own thoughts and decisions.
