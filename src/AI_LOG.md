As I started this project before we new about this AI Log, I dont have exact dates or prompts. But I will try to remember most of it.

## Entry 1

**Date:** jan 19th - 25th 2026
**Task:** Color scheme for website

**Prompt Used:**
Dont remember exact prompt but I asked AI to help find a good color scheme for my witch social media app and i wanted to use purple colors.
I also asked AI to help me find more witchy names for everything really. Like search is now Scry, and newsfeed is the Grimoire and so on.

I also asked AI for what it thought would be a good folder setup for my SPA project. It told me I should use src with the folders: router, service, views, utils, ui and state. I have since chosen to add components and initialize to my system to complete it.

I also often use AI to explain errors that shows up in console for me, I find it easier and faster to find out how to fix the error after I get the explanation of why I got the error.
Like one error from console where I had a scope problem. You can ofcourse get that from the console to that it is an uncought promise and so on, but when tired it is a lot easier for the brain to comprehend what the AI is explaining to me like i am a toddler.

I Also had to ask it when I had some issued with my router and github pages, I had a rough idea and it helped me finesse it so it worked properly.
This is that code :
const base = '/JS2_CA';
let path = window.location.pathname;

if (path.startsWith(base)) {
path = path.slice(base.length) || '/';
}

Another thing it helped me with was to install tailwindcss, I wanted to try it out and immediately got some issues that AI helped me solve. Like going back 1 vs. and also fix the vite configs for using it.
And ofcourse in the beginning how to use tailwindcss, but it has been very intuitive to learn the way I have done it in this assignment, and we will probably learn to do it in a totally different way soon!

Used Ai to learn more about optional chaining after reading about it on MDN first. Had some issues that almost crashed things for me, and this was a solution that I had in the back of my mind and had noted in my notebook , but was not that familiar with so I asked. might be using it too much now.. but still learning.
